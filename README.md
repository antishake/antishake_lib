# Antishake_lib
Anti-shake library is a project to develop a standard library for mobile application which Stabilizes content for Shaking Screens. Henceforth Anti-shake library can be integrated with any application without the need to rewrite applications to stabilize the screen 

# Usage

Anti-shake library will Provide core functionality to process accelerometer input and to produce transformation vectors. Transformation vectors are the corrective measures used to modify the screen motion  relative to its device  motion and hence will stabilize the content in the shaking screen. It can used as a software interface for developing applications in various platforms.

# Development
 
To use  Anti-shake library functionality use ``` import io.github.antishake ```

# Import antishake_lib into Third party android application

Download the latest release of antishake_lib.jar file from 'releases' under 'Code' tab in GitHub
Place the antishake_lib.jar in the 'libs' directory under 'apps' in the android application
Add the dependencies in build.gradle file under 'apps' directory as
